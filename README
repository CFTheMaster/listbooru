Listbooru is a service for various Redis-backed functions including saved 
searches. It includes a daemon that listens on Amazon SQS for update requests 
and a simple web frontend to handle query requests.

You can deploy using Capistrano. It's recommended you fork this project and
modify the following files:

  config/deploy/production.rb
  .env

A sample .env file called .env-SAMPLE is included in the project. The .env
file itself is symlinked during deployment so you should create a version on
the server at /var/www/listbooru/shared/.env.
